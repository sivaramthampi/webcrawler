# Project Overview

This collaborative mini project, developed by a team of three, aims to identify all broken links on a specified website. Throughout this project, I gained insights into MongoDB structure and various internet concepts. My primary focus was on extracting all links from `<a>` tags, displaying the results, and storing the data in a MongoDB collection.
